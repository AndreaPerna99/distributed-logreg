## 🧠 About the Project

This project implements a **distributed classification** system using **Gradient Tracking (GT)** in a multi-agent framework. It is divided into three main parts:

- 🔄 **Distributed Optimization** — Solving a quadratic consensus problem using Gradient Tracking.
- 🧮 **Centralized Classification** — Logistic regression via gradient descent on synthetic data.
- 🛰 **Distributed Classification** — Classifying data distributed across agents using Gradient Tracking.

Implemented in a fully interactive **Jupyter Notebook**, this project demonstrates the real-world applicability of decentralized learning algorithms for nonlinear classification tasks.

## 🧪 Tasks Breakdown

### 🚀 Task 1.1 – Distributed Optimization

- Implements Gradient Tracking on a network of agents solving a decentralized quadratic optimization problem.
- Agents reach consensus using a doubly-stochastic weighted graph.
- Test different topologies: cycle, path, star.
- Plots include agents' states, gradient norms, and cost convergence.

### 🧠 Task 1.2 – Centralized Classification

- Generate 2D datasets labeled by nonlinear conic functions (e.g., ellipse, parabola).
- Apply centralized Gradient Descent for logistic regression.
- Evaluate classification on train/test sets and compute key metrics.

### 🌐 Task 1.3 – Distributed Classification

- Extend Task 1.1 and 1.2 to a fully distributed setting.
- Split data among agents with or without label noise.
- Use GT to minimize logistic loss collaboratively.
- Visualize decision boundaries and metric evolution.
- Classify with and without label noise and compare results.

## 📊 Output & Evaluation

- 📉 Plots: Cost evolution, gradient norms, decision boundaries.
- 📋 Metrics: Classification error, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (train & test).
- ✅ Distributed version matches centralized accuracy with small performance drop under noise.
